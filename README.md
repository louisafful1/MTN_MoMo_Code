# MTN_MoMo_Code
This is a simple JavaScript project that demonstrates the use of nested if statements. The project was created to teach a friend about the concept of nested conditionals in programming. It provides a basic simulation of a mobile money menu using nested if statements.

## Project Background
The project was developed in response to a friend's request to explain the concept of nested if statements in programming. Since I didn't have access to a computer at the time and had only my phone, I decided to create this project as a practical demonstration with a text editor on my phone (trededit). To make the explanation more tangible, I decided to create a practical example that uses nested if statements to simulate the MTN mobile money service's menu options. The simulation allowed me to visually explain the flow of control based on conditions, helping my friend understand the fundamental logic behind decision-making in programming.

## Project Description
The project consists of a simple JavaScript script that simulates the interaction with a mobile money service. The simulation is based on nested if statements to present menu options and handle user inputs. By selecting different options, the user can navigate through the simulated menu and experience the behavior of nested conditionals in programming.

## The main features 
1. Simulated menu options using nested if statements.
2. Handling user inputs to navigate through the menu.
3. Generating a random transaction ID for each transaction.
4. Authenticating a mobile number and PIN for the transaction.
5. Displaying appropriate messages based on user choices.

 ##  How to Use
1. Open the project's HTML file in a browser.
2. The simulation will prompt the user with menu options.
3. Follow the prompts by entering the corresponding numbers to navigate through the menu.
4. Observe how the simulation's behavior changes based on the nested if statements.

Please note that this project is intended for educational purposes and serves as an example of how nested if statements can be utilized in programming.
